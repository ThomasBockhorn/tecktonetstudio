                    I first got into web development with an invitation by
                    Udacity including a Google scholarship for their front-end
                    web development program. After taking a few lessions, I
                    became hooked on all things web development. To further my
                    education, I took and continue to take Udemy courses for
                    both front-end and back-end development. The beauty of both
                    technical and asthetic spheres and how they interacted
                    together fascinated me. Just like architecture, good
                    websites need to consider both form and function.
